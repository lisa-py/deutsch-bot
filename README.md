### Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to apply the foundational concepts of Python learned on my first day of re-study. It's a practical demonstration of my ability to write a functional script from scratch, moving beyond passive learning and immediately into active creation.

### Key Features & Concepts Demonstrated

*   **User Interaction:** The bot greets the user and prompts for input using `print()` and `input()` functions.
*   **Variables:** Stores user names, scores, and other dynamic information.
*   **Data Types:** Utilizes `strings` for words and `integers` for tracking progress or scores.
*   **Lists:** Organizes a collection of German words or phrases for the quiz.
*   **Dictionaries:** Stores the German-to-English vocabulary pairs for efficient key-value lookup (`{ 'Hallo': 'Hello' }`).
*   **GitHub:** This project marks my first commit to GitHub, establishing my practice of version control from day one.

### How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the script using the command: `python name_of_your_script.py`
